# CURRENCIES CONVERTOR
A project @ [BeCode.org](https://becode.org/) as part of the **AI Bootcamp** in Gent
# Project description
This Python code allows you to convert between different currencies. It uses the OpenExchangeRates API to get the latest exchange rates.
# Installation
1. Clone [Currency-conversion](https://github.com/MykolaSenko/Currency-conversion.git) repository
2. Change directory to the root of the repository
3. Install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# Usage
Run the following command in your terminal:
python main.py

This will start the currency converter. You will see current exchange rates of 163 currencies to USD. Than you will be prompted to enter the currency you want to exchange, the amount you want to exchange, and the currency you want to receive. The code will then calculate the amount of currency you will receive.

Example
Here is an example of how to use the code:

python main.py

Which currency do you want to exchange? Input 3 letters as in the dataframe above: USD

You've input USD. Please, input an amount you want to exchange: 100

You've input 100 USD. Please, input currency you want to receive: EUR

For 100 USD you will receive 105.81 EUR.
